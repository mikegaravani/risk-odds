# Risk Odds Calculator

This simple probability app returns the odds of winning a territory in _Risk_, a popular board game.

In the game, each territory is owned by a player and patrolled by at least one little army. A player can attack an adjacent territory owned by someone else.

The fate of the attacked territory is determined by turns of dice rolls, where up to 6 dice are rolled per turn.

This app provides the probability (expressed as a percentage) that the attacking player will successfully conquer the enemy's territory, based on the number of attacking and defending armies.
